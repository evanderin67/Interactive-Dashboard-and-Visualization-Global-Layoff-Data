# Project Conclusion

From the project, it can be concluded that

In 2022 we often hear news about layoffs, there is always news about layoffs reported by the media in various companies in the world. These layoffs occur in various sectors, although dominated by startups, but for established sectors such as Unilever and some service sectors also layoff their employees. Global layoffs greatly affect the Indonesian economy because foreign investment is increasing very rapidly (up 31.8% from the previous year) and many foreign companies are in Indonesia.** So if a company layoffs its employees, there is a possibility that layoffs applies in Indonesia**. Therefore, the Ministry of Manpower needs to know the global layoff conditions.

Globally, the number of employees being laid off continues to increase from January to November, with the lowest 260 employees, highest 13,429 employees, and average of 5,657 employees being laid off per month. In 2022 there were already 956 layoffs with the highest number of layoffs in November (170 layoffs) and lowest number of layoffs in January (3 layoffs).
